                            <h2>History</h2>
                            <p>Founded in 1998 by lifelong river guide Juma Dalnjebo, Dalnjebo Mamba Rafting started as a community-run outfit offering short, safe floats on the nearby river. What began as a neighborhood pastime quickly grew into a regional business as word spread about the team's local knowledge, friendly guides, and commitment to safety.</p>

                            <p>Throughout the 2000s the company expanded its offerings from family-friendly day trips to technical runs and multi-day expeditions. Dalnjebo Mamba invested heavily in guide training and modern safety equipment, earning certifications and partnerships with regional conservation groups. The company became known for combining adventurous whitewater with responsible stewardship of river ecosystems.</p>

                            <p>Today Dalnjebo Mamba is a full-service rafting outfitter that emphasizes sustainable tourism, community employment, and authentic outdoor experiences. They continue to support local conservation projects, mentor young guides, and design trips that welcome beginners while challenging experienced rafters.</p>
