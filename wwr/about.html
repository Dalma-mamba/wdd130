                    <p>Throughout the 2000s the company expanded its offerings from family-friendly day trips to
                        technical runs and multi-day expeditions. Dalnjebo Mamba invested heavily in guide training and
                        modern safety equipment, earning certifications and partnerships with regional conservation
                        groups. The company became known for combining adventurous whitewater with responsible
                        stewardship of river ecosystems.</p>

                    <p>Today Dalnjebo Mamba is a full-service rafting outfitter that emphasizes sustainable tourism,
                        community employment, and authentic outdoor experiences. They continue to support local
                        conservation projects, mentor young guides, and design trips that welcome beginners while
                        challenging experienced rafters.</p>
