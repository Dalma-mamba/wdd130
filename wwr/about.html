            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Dalnjebo Rafting began as a small dream along the rushing banks of the Great Usutu River. Back in
                2014, its founder,
                Dalnjebo M., was just a young explorer who loved two things—wild water and bringing people together.
                After years of
                guiding friends through hidden rapids and secluded river bends, he decided to turn his passion into
                something bigger.
                With one second-hand raft, a toolbox, and a vision of creating unforgettable adventures, Dalnjebo
                Rafting was born.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, tours were simple sunrise drifts, where guests learned about the river’s wildlife and
                local legends. But as
                word spread about the company’s warm, fearless guides and safe, exciting rides, the business grew.
                By 2018, Dalnjebo
                Rafting added advanced routes, team-building events, and night-raft glow tours that quickly became a
                regional favorite.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Dalnjebo Rafting is known as one of the most trusted and energetic rafting companies in the
                region. What started
                as one person’s love for nature turned into a full team dedicated to adventure, safety, and the joy
                of helping people
                experience the river like never before. And through it all, the company still carries its original
                motto:
            </p>
            <p><em>“Ride the river. Chase the thrill. Remember the journey."</em></p>
